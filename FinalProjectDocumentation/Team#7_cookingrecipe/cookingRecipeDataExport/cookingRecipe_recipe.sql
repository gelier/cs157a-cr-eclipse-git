Mix the corn flour in half cup water and combine with the paste and let it simmer and thicken.\n\n            Step by step recipe for Chili Garlic Fried rice:\n            1. Wash, soak and cook the rice, with double measure of water, pepper powder, star anise and crushed garlic. (Check how to make vegetable fried rice, for exact cooking instructions for perfect fried rice). Transfer the cooked rice to a tray, spread well and allow to cool well.\n            2. Chop the garlic and vegetables finely.\n            3. Cut red chilies into fine rounds or crush red chillies and keep aside.\n            4. Heat oil in a thick wok/ pan and add finely chopped garlic. If you like burnt garlic, let it brown slightly (or fry for half a minute) then add red chilies cut into rounds.\n            5. Next, add chopped beans and fry for a minute, then add chopped carrot and continue to stir fry for another minute, followed by cabbage, onion and capsicum, enough salt and stir fry on high flame for a minute.\n            6.

Wash rice few times till the water runs clear. Soak in ample amount of water for 30 mins. Drain and set aside.\n            2. Bring 2 to 2 ½ liters water to a boil in a pot or a cooker. Add bay leaf and shahi jeera. You can also use cinnamon,\n               cloves and cardamoms. If you do not like to get a bite of the spices in the rice, you can also tie these in a muslin\n               cloth and add to the pot.\n            3. Meanwhile, Heat 3 tbsp. oil in a biryani pot , handi or pan. Add sliced onions and fry evenly until golden.\n            4. These onions lend a unique and authentic flavor, so do not skip these.\n            5. When they turn dark brown, set aside  ¼ portion of these fried onions.\n            6. When the water comes to a boil, add salt and drained rice and cook until al dente or 90 % done.\n            Making gravy for chicken dum biryani recipe\n            7. While the rice cooks, let us make the chicken ready. To the rest of the onions, add 1 small bay leaf,\n               star anise, ½ tsp shahi jeera, 3 cardamoms, 4 cloves. Saute just for a min without burning.\n            8. Add 1 tbsp. ginger garlic paste.\n            9. Saute on a medium flame until the raw smell of ginger garlic goes off.\n            10.

I use this HOMEMADE BIRYANI MASALA.\n                Just a reminder about the rice, do check it.\n            13. Mix everything well and fry for 3 mins. After that cover and cook on a low flame for 3 to 4 mins for\n                the chicken to release the moisture.\n            14. Add 1 cup thick curd / yogurt.\n            15. Stir, cover and cook on a medium flame until chicken is soft and tender.\n            16. While the chicken cooks, check the rice. Drain off the rice to a colander when cooked to al dente. The rice\n                must be 90 % cooked meaning you must feel the bite when you bite through a rice grain. Rice should be firm and\n                grainy but not mushy.\n            17. When the chicken is cooked completely, a thick gravy is left in the pot with oil separated. Check the salt now and add more if needed. Stir well and sprinkle chopped coriander and pudina leaves.\n                Layering chicken dum biryani\n            18. Layer the rice over the chicken gravy. Sprinkle fried onions, pudina and coriander leaves.\n                You can also add the optional ingredients – pour the saffron soaked milk, ghee and kewra water evenly.\n                For multilayer check the recipe card below.\n            19. Cover the pot with a foil or a thick clean moist cloth.\n            20. Cover with a air tight lid to trap the steam or dum. If you do not have a\n                tight lid then you can place a heavy pot over the lid. You can mix 1 ½ cups atta\n                with water and make a dough. Stick the dough to the rim of the lid. Press it off on\n                to the pot, for a air tight seal. Place this pot on a hot tawa and cook for about 12 to 15 mins\n                on a medium heat. Once done switch off and allow to rest for at least 20 mins.\n            21. Aromatic hyderanbadi chicken dum biriyani is ready.\n            22. Serve hot or warm with raita and shorva.\n        ',1),(8,'Chicken Taco','\n            1. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano,\n               garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.\n               Season chicken with chili powder mixture.\n\n            2. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.\n               Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through,\n               reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side.\n               Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces.\n\n            3. Serve chicken in tortillas, topped with pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro and lime.\n\n        ',1),(9,'Breakfast Burrito','\n            1. Cook the potatoes in bacon fat.\n            All good breakfast burritos have some sort of potato component. To keep prep to an absolute minimum,\n            we use frozen hash browns. They cook quickly and crisp up nicely.\n            2. Season the eggs at the last minute.\n            According to Gordon Ramsay, adding salt in the beginning draws out moisture and makes eggs watery.\n            So wait to do it until the very end.\n            3. Use a sharp, tangy, or spicy cheese.\n            Obviously cheddar is perfect because it melts nicely. But gouda (sharp), goat cheese (tangy), or\n            pepper jack spicy work really too. Mild varieties like mozzarella or Monterey jack are totally\n            acceptable but they do not add nearly as much flavor.\n            4. Do not use a cold tortilla.\n            It will be really hard to fold and roll and will likely break on you. Warm or room temp makes things\n            much easier. And if you are still struggling knowing how to do it, watch around :30 of this Cheesy\n            Baked Burrito vid.\n        ',1),(10,'Chicken Wings','\n            1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Dab wings with paper towels until completely dry.\n            2. Toss wings with flour, salt and pepper. Remove any excess flour and brush with olive oil (or use an olive oil spray).\n            3. Line a pan with foil and then place parchment paper on top (you may need 2 pans) and bake 35 minutes turning at 20 minutes.\n            4. Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients in a small pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes or until slightly\n                thickened and sauce coats the back of a spoon.\n            5. Take wings from oven, toss with sauce and return to the oven for 10 minutes, turning after 5 minutes.\n            6. Allow to cool 10 minutes. As the sauce cools, it thickens. Stir the wings every few minutes to coat in the sauce as it thickens.\n        ',1);
